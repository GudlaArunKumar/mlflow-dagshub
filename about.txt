Initially the tracking server url is set to local, so mlruns is created in local folder.

So we will replace local server with dagshub as remote server.


In Dagshub 

-> Create a new repository 
-> connect a repository 
-> Go to Remote (drop down) -> select Experiments to get the remote tracking URL 
-> Open gitbash and export all those env variables(tracking URI, user name and password) taken from above
